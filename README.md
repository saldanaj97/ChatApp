# Chatroom.io
## Current Features
Currently, the chatroom only allows the user to type in a username and a chatroom name or number which then allows them to enter that specific room with specified name. If the user inputs a username that is already being used, then they will be notified to input another name. Other users will then be notified when a new user enters the room as well as notified when a user leaves the room as well. Once a user logs out using the logout button in the chatroom, the username will then become available again. 

The frontend code is located in chat-client and the backend code is located in chat-server. 

Screenshots below are from v1.0.0. Expect to see changes as more features are added.
